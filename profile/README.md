# Actionforge

Welcome to the Actionforge source code!

Actionforge introduces Action Graphs, a faster and easier way to create and execute GitHub workflows. This new approach replaces tedious YAML file editing by hand with a user-friendly graph editor. Action Graphs are compatible with GitHub Actions. The core product consists out of 4 components:

- ♾️ [VS Code Extension](https://www.github.com/actionforge/vscode-ext) - Extension to modify Action Graphs within VS Code.
- 🟢 [GitHub Action](https://www.github.com/actionforge/action) - GitHub Action that reads the Action Graph and starts the Graph Runner with it.
- 🏃‍♀️ [Graph Runner](https://www.github.com/actionforge/graph-runner) - The cli program that executes an Action Graph.
- 🕸️ Graph Editor - Visual graph editor to create and build Action Graphs.

For examples check out the [Actionforge Examples](https://www.github.com/actionforge/examples) 🔗 repository.
